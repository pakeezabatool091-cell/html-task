<img src="bio.png" alt="">
        </html><p>I choose this field because when I completed my FSC ,my marks were not very good like a students who want to choose the path of mbbs or mdcat so on process.so from the day after when I gave last paper,I tried my best to search the degrees which gave me advantages in future so my search shows all signs towards this degree and side by side my one of the best teacher of fsc encouraged me to choose this degree so i choose this. I just knew the name and somehow introduction of this degree before choosing this and nothing more than that.
